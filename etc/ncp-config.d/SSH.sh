DESCRIPTION="Activate or deactivate SSH"
INFOTITLE="SSH notes"
INFO="In order to enable SSH, the password for user 'pi' can NOT remain set to the default raspberry.
You HAVE to create a NEW password for 'pi' if you want this program to enable SSH, it will fail if you dont!
The same will happen with user 'root' and password '1234'
Note: Use normal AlphaNumeric, the only special characters allowed are .,@-_/"
